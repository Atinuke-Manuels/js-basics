## Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category.

Statically typed programming languages perform type check at compile time i.e if the script contains an error it will fail to compile until the error is fixed. It also requires that you declare the data type of variables before usage e.g Java and C.

while

Dynamically typed programming languages perform type checking at runtime and you do not need to declare the data type of variables before every use e.g Javascript and Python.
